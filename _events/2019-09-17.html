<p>A defining feature of the American Dream is upward income mobility â€” the ideal that children have equal opportunities to succeed in life, regardless of the circumstances of their birth. Join us for a conversation with The Policy Lab's John Friedman, who will discuss his research using large administrative datasets to uncover where opportunity lacks in America, and what policymakers and civic leaders can do about it to revive the American Dream for future generations.</p>
