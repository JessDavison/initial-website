In her bestselling book, <a href="http://www.brigidschulte.com/books/overhelmed/">Overwhelmed</a>, Brigid Schulte, a former staff writer for The Washington Post and Director of the <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/better-life-lab/">Better Life Lab</a> at the New America Foundation, asks: Are our brains, our partners, our culture, and our work making it impossible for us to experience anything but "contaminated time?" Join Brigid and The Policy Lab for a conversation about the habits and stresses we're carrying around every day, and the cultural, structural, and policy changes that can help us live happier, fuller lives.
