Although urban violence is one of the most divisive issues of our time, Harvard scholar Thomas Abt shows in his book, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/13/741485111/thomas-abt-talks-new-book-on-urban-violence-bleeding-out">Bleeding Out</a>, that we actually possess all the tools necessary to stem violence in our cities. Urgent yet hopeful, he offers practical solutions to the national emergency of urban violence -- and challenges readers to demand action. Join Thomas and The Policy Lab for a conversation about his work and reflections on how to move forward.
